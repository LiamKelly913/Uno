#UNO
----
This is a simple Uno app I made in my spare time.


Tapping underneath the draw card brings up a text field to give yourself specific cards.
Colors are referenced as Blu, Red, Yel, Gre, and Wild. Numbers are 1-9.

##Examples:
* "Gre4" adds a Green 4 to your hand.
* "Yeldraw2" adds a Yellow Draw 2 to your hand.
* "Wilddraw4" adds a Wild Draw 4 to your hand.

Entering "dismiss" will return you to the opponent selection screen
